# D3: World of bits

# Game Design Vision

Game where you collect different items around campus. Combining duplicate items result in higher tiers.

# Technologies

- TypeScript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common `style.css` file
- Deno and Vite for building
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for deployment automation
